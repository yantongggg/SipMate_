UI: React Native
Styling: StyleSheet.create
Database & Authentication: Supabase
State Management: React Context API
Fonts: @expo-google-fonts (Playfair Display)
Icons: lucide-react-native
Storage: @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
Animations: react-native-reanimated
Gesture Handling: react-native-gesture-handler
Image Handling: expo-image-picker, expo-file-system, expo-sharing

Project Structure
app/: Contains all routes and screens.
(tabs)/: Primary tab-based navigation.
admin/: Admin panel routes.
auth.tsx: Authentication screen.
wine-details.tsx: Detailed wine view.
_layout.tsx: Root layout.
components/: Reusable UI components (e.g., WineCard, SaveWineModal, DatePicker, LocationPicker).
contexts/: React Contexts for global state management (Auth, Wine, Theme, Settings).
hooks/: Custom React hooks (e.g., useFrameworkReady, useAuthGuard).
lib/: Utility functions (e.g., supabase.ts, imageUtils.ts).
supabase/: Supabase migrations and database schema.
types/: TypeScript type definitions.
Important Constraints
Web Platform Default: The project's default platform is Web. Native-only APIs (like Haptics, Local Authentication, some Sensors) are not available. Web-compatible alternatives or Platform.select() for platform-specific code must be used.
useFrameworkReady Hook: The useFrameworkReady hook code in app/_layout.tsx is REQUIRED and must NEVER be removed or modified. This code is essential for the framework to function properly.
Expo Managed Workflow: This project uses Expo managed workflow exclusively. DO NOT create ios or android directories. No native code files should be included in the project directly.
Styling: Use StyleSheet.create for all styling. DO NOT use NativeWind or any alternative styling libraries unless explicitly asked for.
Error Handling: Prefer showing errors directly in the UI instead of using the Alert API. Use error states in components to display error messages inline.
Environment Variables: Use Expo's environment variable system. DO NOT use Vite environment variables. Environment variables must be prefixed with EXPO_PUBLIC_.
Dependencies: ALWAYS maintain ALL existing dependencies in package.json. DO NOT remove any pre-configured dependencies.
Fonts: Use @expo-google-fonts packages for any font implementation. DO NOT use local font files or custom font loading methods. ALWAYS follow the standard pattern for loading and using Google Fonts.
File Management: To remove a route, use rm -rf "path/to/route/file".
Navigation Architecture:
Primary Navigation: Tabs using expo-router's built-in tab support.
Secondary Navigation: Stack Navigation, Modal Navigation, or Drawer Navigation can be implemented WITHIN tab screens.
Icons: Use the lucide icon library exclusively by importing icons as React components from lucide-react-native. Follow SVG prop defaults for consistency (size: 24, color: 'currentColor', strokeWidth: 2, absoluteStrokeWidth: false). For Lucide Lab or custom icons, use the Icon component.
Camera Usage: Use expo-camera for implementing camera features. Always check and request permissions before camera access.
API Routes: Expo Router enables writing secure server code for all platforms in the app directory using +api.ts extension. Project app.json must have "output": "server" under web configuration.
Preferred Libraries:
react-native-reanimated instead of Animated from react-native.
react-native-gesture-handler instead of PanResponder.
Payments: For subscriptions or in-app purchases, RevenueCat is the preferred solution. Note that RevenueCat requires native code and will not function in Boltâ€™s in-browser preview; a development build using the Expo Dev Client is needed for testing.
